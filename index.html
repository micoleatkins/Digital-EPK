    <p>Electric style, soft backgrounds, and laid back vocals would be a perfect description for R&B singer
      Reese. From an early age Reese had a passion for music and songwriting which was heavily
      influenced by her father. Reese was born and raised in Memphis by her entrepreneur mom and hard
      working grandmother. At only 14 years old Reese mom passed away to cancer, and during that time
      she felt like she lost her passion for music. She later spent her teens growing up in Atlanta where
      she was introduced to new sounds and new ways to express yourself artistically. As the years pass
      and life happens Reese decided to take her career in music seriously by releasing her first song
      “Nostalgic” under the name Ree-Skye on SoundCloud. She then went on to release a follow up single
      titled “Waiting” and “4pgs”. After a name change in 2019, she released her first EP titled “Vintage
      Vagina”. As she continues to write and record she’s currently working on her sophomore EP titled
      “Maybe I am Toxic” that she’s super excited to create.
      Reese has a versatile style where she can give off complete sex appeal while still staying true to her
      Memphis roots. She’s a true visionary, and also has a passion for creative direction over her
      projects. We like to say that Reese is definitely one of a kind as she gives off iconic vibes.
